HOMEWORK LOCATION:
https://github.com/trvaughn/simple_interactive_webpage.git

COMPLEXITY [EASY / HARD]:
HARD at first, then EASY.  There were a lot of new things to pick up:
Trello, Angular, Javascript/Typescript, Plunker, jQuery...

Once became comfortable(ish) with these, the work became easier. 


APPROXIMATION OF HOURS INVESTED IN ASSIGNMENT:
Participation: 5 hours
Homework: 3.5 hours

EXPECTED GRADE: A

DESCRIBE APPLICATION INTENT:
 The app has a collection of buttons that apply different functionality to the web page.  Example, a user can toggle on/off color, reverse order, etc. 

 Added a helper function for reloading the html.  Originally thought it was going to be used more, but was used enough to where I am comfortable with it. 

 Toughest part was that I am an idiot. I was editing the .txt file and wondering why the web page wasn't changing! I used sublime, so the .txt file's syntax looked like html :/
